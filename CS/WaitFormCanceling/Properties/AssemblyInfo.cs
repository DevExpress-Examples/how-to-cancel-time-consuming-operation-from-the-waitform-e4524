// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to cancel time-consuming operation from the WaitForm
// 
// This example illustrates how to cancel a time-consuming operation on a WaitForm.
// To accomplish this task, place a BackgroundWorker and SplashScreenManager onto a
// Form, and add the Cancel button in the WaitForm's designer. The main idea is to
// perform data loading in a background thread, pass the ILocked object both to the
// WaitForm and to this thread, and check its condition while data is loading.
// 
// You can find sample updates and versions for different programming languages here:

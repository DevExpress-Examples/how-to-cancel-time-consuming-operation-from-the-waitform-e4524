<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to cancel time-consuming operation from the WaitForm</h1>
<p>
This example illustrates how to cancel a time-consuming operation on a WaitForm. To accomplish this task, place a BackgroundWorker and SplashScreenManager onto a Form, and add the Cancel button in the WaitForm's designer.  
The main idea is to perform data loading in a background thread, pass the ILocked object both to the WaitForm and to this thread, and check its condition while data is loading.</p>
